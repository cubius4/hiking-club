A program which stores a database of fictional hikes and allows the user to see and manipulate the data.
The program stores a list of registered hikers as well as the locations they will hike in.
The user can view:
    - The total registered list of hikers
    - The total hike time for a certain hiker
    - The total hike time for a certain location

Note that this is one of my first programs so it is most probably unorganized.
